    <h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1>

       Cassie's POV<br>

Cassie took a deep breath and put on a big smile on her face as she came in contact with the cafe glass door. Today was the day her life changed. Things were finally on the verge of turning around for her and she had no idea. She moved to a new town for the first time without her parents. She had just landed herself a job interview with Avestr forensic institute as a forensic psychologist. I mean, who wouldn't love to work for their dream company.<br>

Cassie fixes her clothing and casually walks inside the Cafe. Immediately after setting foot in this unfamiliar environment, she felt her stomach turn. Which was weird because this was one feeling that doesn't happen often in Cassie's body. She assumed it was because she was about to be interviewed, so she brushed it off as nerves. After all, this was a huge opportunity for her.<br>

She scans for two men in suits and mistakenly notices a pair of dark eyes staring at her from across behind the counter. A man in a worn apron, frozen halfway through wiping a table, staring at her as if he's seen a ghost. Cassie's stomach turned once more. Do I know him? She thought. No, she doesn't. She shook it off. He was probably just a creep that stares at every woman entering the shop in professional clothing. She had more important things to focus on, like making sure that she impresses the managers of Avestr forensic institute. Still, she couldn't shake that weird feeling off, like she had just unlocked a door she wouldn't be able to close off, and she didn't even know it.<br>

Her eyes lingered in the room one more time, hoping the feeling would pass soon. They landed on the two men in suits at the far end of the corner, signaling her to come over. The tension in her stomach remains as she walks confidently towards them and greets them.<br>

“You must be Cassie.” One of the interviewers, Mr Thompson spoke while  adjusting his tie. <br>
“Yes sir.” <br>
“We apologize for the informal setting, our office Is currently under construction, so we had to move a few of our meetings to this cafe instead of canceling them. We hope you don't mind.” The second interviewer Mrs Jefferson replied.<br>
“Not at all, the coffee is better here anyways.” She says jokingly. Mr Thompson chuckles. “Can we start?” He mentions.<br>
“Of course.” She nodded.<br>
“Because we already know more about you and your background, we would like to know now, what made you choose forensic psychology?” They ask.<br>
Cassie's face automatically fills with a smile, grateful for a question she could answer without hesitation. “I have always been interested in people's behavior and actions. The “why” in it. Why do people act that way, why do they think that way, why are they like this. Especially when it comes to criminal behaviour. I believe understanding the mind and how it works, can help not only solve future crimes but to prevent them as well.”<br>

Mrs Jefferson writes down something on her laptop, before looking up to ask, “Working in this field can be emotionally draining. How do you plan on managing the stress that comes with working here?”<br>
Cassie hesitates for a second before answering. Not because she didn't know how to answer the question, but because she saw that man behind the counter again staring at her from across the room. His eyes pierced directly at her, you'd swear her life was to be in danger. She quickly brushed it off and focused on the question. “I manage my stress by reminding myself why I am here. I am here to help. And I dedicate myself to exercise when I get the opportunity, this helps with calming my mind down and helping me to think thoroughly. Besides work, I do have hobbies to keep me relaxed and balanced. That way I know that when work becomes too stressful for me, I will be able to handle the stress without having my mental health affected. Afterall, staying grounded is very important in this field, as we not only deal with the victims but with their families as well.”<br>
Mr Thompson slightly smiled while drafting something on his laptop. “Last one Cassie,” he thought. “Imagine you're given only behavioral evidence to profile a suspect. What's your approach? You can take your time.”<br>

Cassie took a deep breath and took some time to think about her answer. She already knew what to say, she figured that thinking about the questions first before answering might have a good impression on her interviewers as understanding is very important. “I would start by analyzing the suspect's actions. Every behaviour leaves a trace of a person's habits, personality and sometimes even their emotional state. I'd look at things like how organized a crime scene is, if it's too organized it means it took planning and control for the crime to happen. If it's chaotic, it might suggest impulsively or emotional instability. I would also pay attention to any repeated behaviours or signatures, anything that the suspect does that isn't related to the crime but satisfies a psychological need, such as leaving notes or choosing a certain type of victim. Finally I can build a profile based on this, estimating their age range, social skills, possible occupation, emotional triggers, stress levels etc. Behavior never looks random, even if it looks messy, it can tell you who you're dealing with.” She smiles.<br>

“Wow Cassie, you must know your work huh.” Mrs Jefferson comments before typing on her laptop. “Thank you for your time.”<br>
“Expect a call from us soon.” Mr Thomspon replies. “Thank you.”<br>
“Thank you for having me.” <br>
They all stand up from their seats and shake hands. Cassie notices that man once more as she prepares to leave. She clutches her bag tightly before exiting the door.<br>
