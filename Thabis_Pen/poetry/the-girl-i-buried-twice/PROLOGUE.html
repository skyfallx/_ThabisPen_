       “But how do you forget a memory that keeps remembering you?”<br>

This question has been resonating in my mind for weeks now since the last time I saw her. Cassie, that is. Everything in my life was going great, I was months away from being promoted to manager at my workplace. Then she walked in, one random day and it suddenly felt as if seven years ago was just yesterday. Seven years since that night happened, since everything went wrong.<br>

I wouldn't call what happened an accident though. It was bound to happen. It's not my fault, I promise. She wanted to leave me, to erase me from her life, and I couldn't let that happen. My heart wouldn't survive the ache. All I ever wanted was to make her happy. She wanted to leave me. But in the end, as good of a person as I am, I let her go, or at least, I thought I did.<br>

I mean, she pushed me, and I pushed her back. Literally. I had no other choice, did I? (sigh) When blood flowed out of her head… when I saw the light fading from her eyes… It was I who walked away. And now, seven years later, here she is. Inside my workplace. Smiling as if nothing happened, as if she doesn't remember a single thing. As if she doesn't remember… me.<br>

But I remember. And I remember everything.
