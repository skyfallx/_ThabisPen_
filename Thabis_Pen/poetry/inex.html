        <p>Out of boredom and curiosity, Samantha Combs performs a forbidden ritual from a book she found at an antique store, and unknowingly binds herself to a mysterious female demon.

When her family discovers the truth, they try to "save" her with a secret ritual, banishing her lover forever. Haunted by the loss and the inability to move on, she finds her self thinking of two options: live without love as she thinks she will never find anyone like her, or die to be with her again.
