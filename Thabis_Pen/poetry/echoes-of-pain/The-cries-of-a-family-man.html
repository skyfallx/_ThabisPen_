    <h1>The cries of a family man</h1>
    <p>
        I wake up every day,
To hustle for my family.
Even though I get no respect,
I try to provide for them daily.
My hands are a desert,
I work for hours without rest.
But despite all this,
I still receive the worst.<br>

Dusk till dawn,
It has been years
since I sat down.
I'm going through pain,
I have no choice but to bear.
I am a father and a family man.<br>

My wife's insults,
Are all I can hear.
From her voice and shouts,
I have developed a fear.<br>

My children are embarrassed.
'He's not my father', they say.
Insecure, I've become.
For them to love me, I PRAY. <br>
