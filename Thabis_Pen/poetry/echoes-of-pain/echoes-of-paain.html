    <h1>Echoes of pain</h1>
    <p>
        When the tears stopped falling,
        I thought that it was the end.
        Only to find out that...
        The echoes don't need tears to be heard.<br>

        I've come to learn that
        Pain remembers
        What the heart forgets
        And when it's quiet,
        It starts to creep in
        Bit by bit.<br>

        In the silence,
        It whispers to the ears,
        A slideshow to the mind
        Of every tear,
        Every scar
        Every cry<br>

        But I've grown out of it,
        I've grown to realize that
        All doesn't come back to haunt me,
        But to remind me,
        Of how far I have come,
        Of what I've survived,
        Of the strength I had built along the way.<br>

        And because of time
        I've come to accept it as is.
        I don't resist it anymore
        I listen to it,
        I listen to the echoes of pain.<br>
