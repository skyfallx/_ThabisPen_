    <h1>I'll never forget you</h1>
    <p>
        I'll always remember the fun we had
I never wanted to let you go
Because I loved you, 
I had to set you free
But I'll never forget you<br>

I'll never the memories we shared,
The smiles you brought to me.
I love you even now
I hope you can see
I'll never forget you<br>

You are always in my heart
Even though I'll never see you again
I know we'll never be apart<br>

I'll never forget 
The laughs we had
And the memories we shared
I know that you will
But it doesn't matter anyway<br>
