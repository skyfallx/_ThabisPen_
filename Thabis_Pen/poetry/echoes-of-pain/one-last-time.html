    <h1>One last time</h1>
    <p>
        If only I could go back in time
To the day we first met
I'd make sure to give you the biggest hug
To decrease the feelings that you have of hurt<br>

I'd make sure to check on you
Each and every time
Make sure that you are okay
Make sure that you are happy<br>

They say life is unpredictable
If only I knew
I'd have spent more time with you
For now, I have so many regrets<br>

If you were still here
I'd give you the biggest hug.
And ask you if you are okay
One last time.
