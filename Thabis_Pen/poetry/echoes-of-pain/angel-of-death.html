    <h1>Angel of death</h1>
    <p>
        You float among the weak,
Whisper the words of defeat.
You consume a healthy mind,
Oh, how distorted you are.<br>

Black as darkness itself,
You express nothing but pain.
You take over one's soul,
Devouring their strength.
Bit by bit, you alter one's power,
Feeding off their happiness from the inside.
Leaving nothing but depression.
Oh, how distorted you are.<br>

Angel of death,
Bring nothing but pain and suffering.
You take families, friends, and acquaintances.
Filling one's spirit with melancholic emotions,
You leave hearts with deep holes that will take time's time to heal.
You are a creature that devours one of their freedom of life.<br>

Angel of death.
You wipe out a person's spirit,
You make them forget their existence.
They say sleep is temporary, but death is forever.
You are forever,
Bad as you are, you are forever.
Oh, angel of death,
How distorted you are.
