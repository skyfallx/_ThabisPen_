<h2>Beneath the petals lies a dance of despair</h2>

    <p>
        She moves with grace, a mournful sway,<br>
        A dancer's form, but a face that's astray.<br>
        Into the shadow's, her identity resides,<br>
        A heart that aches with pain and despair inside.<br>
    </p>    
    <P>
        The petals mask what the heart cannot express,<br>
        A flower that blooms, with its roots, lifeless.<br>
        She years to be seen, to be understood,<br>
        But the mask she wears is a fragile hood.<br>
    </P>
    <p> 
        With every step, she searches for a way,<br>
        To escape this misery, which holds her each day.<br>
        But like a flower, she is rooted in her pain,<br>
        A blooming beauty but decaying in pain.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Longing to be noticed, she dances with all her might,<br>
        A fragile, fading light, in the dark of the night.<br>
        Her heart beating in sorrow and her soul with despair,<br>
        But still she dances, a beauty beyond compare.<br>
    </p>
