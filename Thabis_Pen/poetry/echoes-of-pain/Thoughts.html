    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        They flow like a rive,<br>
        bringing boats filled<br>
        with the memories of us<br>
    </p>    
    <p>
        I remember every moment<br>
        As i shed these tears waiting to fall.<br>
        They say love with your heart,<br>
        But take your mind with you.<br>
        My heart wanted you gone<br>
        but my mind kept you caged<br>
        what more could i ask for?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought that everything would be fine,<br>
        But the thoughts of you<br>
        Kept flooding in like the great tsunami in 2004 Indonesia.<br>
        My life was a highway,<br>
        That led nowhere but forward and backward.<br>
        I kept going backwards,<br>
        With the hope of finding you<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        But life had other plans.<br>
        Now all I have are these memories of you,<br>
        Prisoned in my mind with no chance of getting out.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The thoughts of you<br>
        Keep flowing like a river,<br>
        Bringing more old memories of us<br>
        With no aim of being forgotten.<br>
    </p>
