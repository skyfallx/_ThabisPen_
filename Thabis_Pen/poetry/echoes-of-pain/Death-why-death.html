    <h1>Death, why death</h1>
    <p>
        You come unexpected
You take life away
You take our loved ones away
You take our happiness away
And leave us with nothing but misery<br>

Death, why death
You took my mother away
You took my father away
You took my sibling away
Why!! Why!!<br>

You are like the truth,
Itâ€™s always sad but it's true.
Why do you always take those close to us.
I wonder how the world would be if you didn't exist.<br>

Some say death teaches us to be stronger.
But how can we be stronger if we don't have anyone,
We love to encourage us!!
Death, why death?<br>

If only I could touch you, I would end you!!
The five stages of grief take longer than they sound.
I'm in denial when will I finally reach acceptance.
I have no choice but to accept that you'll always be here, 
to hurt us! To take us! To haunt us! For the rest of our lives.
Maybe if you finally take me, I'll understand
that life is a beautiful lie, and you are the sad truth.
Death, why death.<br>
