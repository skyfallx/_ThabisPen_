    <h1>Why was i created</h1>
    <p>
        Why was I created,
With a mouth if
All I'm gonna do is
Hurt people and bring grief<br>

Why was I created,
With a heart
If all that's going to happen,
Is for it to feel pain and fall apart.<br>

Why was I created,
With feelings
If I'm gonna be hurt because
To some people I'm not appealing<br>

Why was I created,
With a mind
If sometimes I think about suicide
Cause I'm not feeling well inside<br>

Why was I created,
If I'm gonna feel pain in life
I just wanted to be loved, cared and happy
Instead, I'm depressed, sad and I overthink when holding a knife
Tell me, why was I created?
