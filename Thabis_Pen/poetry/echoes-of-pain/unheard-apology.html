    <h1>Unheard apology</h1>
    <p>
        you shamed me in public
You saw nothing wrong.
you felt no guilt.
you continued your life,
as if nothing had occurred.
The silence was so strong
and when the time comes
Your apology didn't even make a sound<br>

To this day,
The memory of that moment
Still linger in every corner of my mind
A constant reminder
Of the pain that you caused me.
Your words had cut deeper than a sword
They caused me a wound that’ll take years to heal<br>

Now I’m left to pick up the pieces,
Of a heart broken not by choice,
Shattered by your absence of regret
And an insincere apology
That fell on deaf ears<br>
</p>
