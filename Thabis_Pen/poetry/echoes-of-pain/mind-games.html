    <h1>Mind games</h1>
    <p>
        Breath in...<br>

I’m lost in the haze of my own mind
Scared of the feelings that I’ve come to find
The thought of you, always on my mind
I thought that it was a joke
But now that I’ve come to unwind…<br>

I never thought I could fall,
but here I am, because of you...
I'm drowning in the depths of my own emotions
Your name echoes in my thoughts
It’s a hunting melody
my mouth slipped,
called a stranger by your name
an error that cuts like pain
I'm hunted by your presence
even in my deepest mistaken moments<br>

My head hurts from confusion
This foreign feeling has taken ahold
a cold and exhilarating sensation
I don't know what to do
My mind is racing,
hyperventilating,
overthinking
My poor mind is a mess.<br>

I've never felt like this before,
so vulnerable and exposed
My emotions, raw
my heart burdened by the weight I've imposed
searching for answers in darkness
oh, how hard they are to find
but all I know is that you are always in my mind<br>

breath out...
