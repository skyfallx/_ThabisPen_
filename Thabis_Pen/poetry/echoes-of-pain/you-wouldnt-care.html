    <h1>You wouldn't care</h1>
    <p>
        Would you care if we quit talking
Would you care if I went walking
I need to know how you feel
So, I know how to deal
I like it when you're by my side
I hate it when you try to hide
All the cheating and the lies
Bring me closer to saying goodbye
I know the cheating is a fact
Cause I've caught you in the act
I wish I had more trust in you
But it was kind of hard when I busted you
Seems to me you wouldn't care
Even if I wasn't there
I always wonder who you're with
Hoping that it's not another chick
