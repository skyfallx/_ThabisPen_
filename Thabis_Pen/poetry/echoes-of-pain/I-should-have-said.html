    <h1>I should have said</h1>
    <p>
        I have these words,
Stuck on my throat like a lump of fire,
Unable to burn the same flame. <br>
 
I try so hard to say these few words I have,
Yet my voice whispers, unable to be heard,
ignored like autumn leaves on 
forgotten streets.<br>
 
Is it too late now to go back? 
I have these random thoughts of you, 
About you, what you used to say...<br>

Arenâ€™t you a little human rose 
So beautiful yet so toxic? 
Toxic? No.<br>
 
Yes. 
You were a red rose, hiding your thorns 
behind your beauty.
Your physique, uniqueness and attractiveness... 
Yet the thorns of toxicity and manipulation guard your heart.<br>
 
I wish I had said more than goodbye,
Although it would have fallen into deaf ears...
Lost in the atmosphere of eternity,
Buried by the loud silence
</p>
