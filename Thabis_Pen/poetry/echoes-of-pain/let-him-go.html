    <h1>Let him go</h1>
    <p>
        Let him go baby girl,
He doesn't want you anymore.
Let him go, it's okay
I know your heart will be sore
But please let him be<br>

Stop giving him all you have
He's hurting you okay
And it's not you he deserves<br>

He doesn't need you
You don't need him too
There's only one thing you can do
And it's to let him go<br>

Nice and slow you will heal
You deserve all the happiness
Not what he gave you and made you feel
That's abuse, cruelty and emptiness
So let him go<br>

In time you'll be happy,
trust me
He's not the heart of your life
You are strong, beautiful and brave
If you let him go, 
you'll see<br>
