    <h1>Tell them</h1>
    <p>
        You know what it's fine, tell them.
Tell everyone how I am a bad child and how you hate me.
Tell everyone how you wish I was more like my peers,
Instead of being like this.
It’s fine tell them.<br>

Tell them how much I disappoint you 
and how much I disgust you 
Every time I try to impress you.
It’s fine.<br>

Also tell them how you would swear at me,
and call me names even the strongest people can't take.
Tell them how you would threaten me every now and then 
telling me that you would kick me out of your house.<br>

Tell them how you would compare me to drunkards 
and say I act like them,
whenever I need your motherly love and attention<br>

Tell them how you treat me behind closed doors,
How you would overwork me when I'm sick.
because you thought I was pretending.
What kind of parent are you!<br>

Can't you see?
I'm a child and you are killing me.
Sometimes I wonder how it would be like if I didn't know you.
You do all this to me because you know 
I'm like a plant and you are the sun,
I depend on you.<br>

Sometimes I'd think about suicide 
but my conscience would stop me every time, 
telling me you'll change.<br>

Someday I will go to sleep, and you'll miss me, 
you'll regret treating me like this
and you'll live with guilt for the rest of your life.
That day will be the day I will never wake up.<br>
