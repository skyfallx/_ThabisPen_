    <h1>About the Author</h1>

    <p>Hi, I'm Nqobile Thabitha Mnguni — a November soul, a storyteller, and a dreamer with a soft spot for dark romance and sad poetry.</p>

    <p>I started writing in primary school, where art and culture lessons became my escape. That spark grew brighter at an art school, where I discovered dance and began shaping words into stories. Writing and movement are how I make sense of the world — how I express what I feel, dream, and wish for when reality gets a little too loud.</p>

    <p>I write dark romance with threads of mystery, and poetry that leans into sorrow — the kind born from quiet nights and unspoken thoughts. My stories explore love, longing, and life as it could be if the stars aligned a little differently.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Follow your dreams. Do what you are passionate about and you'll never work a day in your life. Do what you love and make money from it.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>That's a quote I hold close. But the truth? I'm still learning how to live it. I believe in chasing dreams, yet fear sometimes slows me down. Maybe that's why I write — to imagine the version of me who isn't afraid.</p>

    <p>I hope my words feel like a quiet corner in a loud world — a space where your heart can breathe.</p>
